# Hassayampa_bat_communities
An analysis of bat echolocation data collected in five different habitats at the Hassayampa River Preserve outside of Wickenburg, AZ in the Sonoran Desert.  Five different habitats were sampled on the preserve and data analyzed in Python.  Raw data was cleaned, Bat species were graphed by habitat, data tested for normality with Sapiro-Wilks test, hypothesis testing carried out for each species by habitat with Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise comparisons, and communities by habitat tested utilizing rank-MANOVA and pairwise comparison.
